About me
========

- I' m now a Ph.D. student at Beijing University of Chemical Technomlgy (BUCT), and my adviser is Prof. [Zhiqiang Geng](https://cist.buct.edu.cn/2020/0331/c8726a98748/page.htm). Additionally, I completed a one-year joint training program at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) under the guidance of Prof. [Kwoh Chee Keong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/asckkwoh/) and Dr. [Zhenghua Chen](https://zhenghuantu.github.io/). I received my B.S. degree from Beijing University of Chemical Technomlgy in 2018.
